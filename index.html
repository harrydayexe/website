        <h2>Computer Science Undergraduate</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Harry Day, I am a software enginer and student, in my final year of studying Computer Science
            at The University of Manchester. Currently I am working at Novlr, building an online platform for writers.
            Previously I have worked at UBS in Asset Management Technology, building a next generation, asset management
            platform, capable of handling over $5T AUM.
            </br>
            </br>
            As an engineer, I am excited by the prospect of building new solutions, and innovating on existing
            platforms, particularly highly scalable and performant systems. In my spare time, I work on a variety of
            personal projects, including SongLinkr, a utility app for iOS, as well as constantly learning new
            technologies and skills.
            </br>
            </br>
            Outside of work and computer science, I am a keen Formula 1 fan, snowboarder and weightlifter. On the
            weekends you can catch me in the gym, at a race track or refining my NeoVim config!
            </br>
            </br>
            Check out some of my past and present projects below.

                    Omni is my final year dissertation project, a web application for computer science students to show
                    off their personal projects. The focus of the project is to design a platform which could handle
                    scaling from 0 to 1 million users, overnight.
                    </br>
                    The project was built using a GoLang backend, with HTMX and TailwindCSS on the frontend. It is
                    comprised of multiple independent applications which are deployed into a Kubernetes cluster,
                    allowing them to scale separately, depending on load and demand.
                    </br>
                    The project has served as a fantastic learning experience, primarily increasing my experience and
                    confidence in building production ready applications with GoLang. As part of the project, I also
                    deployed a Kubernetes cluster onto a custom HomeLab setup, which was a fantastic learning
                    experience, building my understanding and confidence in how Kubernetes works at a fundamental level.

                    SongLinkr is a simple utility app that takes links to songs, albums and podcasts, and gives you the

                    Utilising the power of Swift and SwiftUI, SongLinkr aims to be a intuitive and natural first class

                    I am currently working as a software engineer at Novlr, building an online writing platform. As part
                    of my role I have built a refer-a-friend system, designed to increase signups and conversions. I
                    also assisted another developer in the team with building a greenfield writing studio, massively
                    improving on the existing platform, to get users writing faster and more efficiently.
                    </br>
                    As part of my job in such a small team, I have also been working alongside our customer support to
                    assist with any technical issues and bugs that arise, solving critical issues for users and ensuring
                    that any lost data is recovered and restored.

                <h3>UBS Technology Placement</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of my degree program, I undertook a year in industry at UBS where I worked within the Asset
                    Management Technology division. During my time at UBS, I worked within multiple teams, developing a
                    next-generation asset management platform, capable of handling over $5T AUM.
                    </br>
                    Primarily working with DotNet and deploying to Azure, I built a library used by multiple other teams
                    to send and retrieve data from our Kafka messaging pipelines. This was a rewarding project which
                    taught me how to develop library code which can be used in many different applications and
                    scenarios.
                    </br>
                    I then moved into a platform focused team, where I worked on a greenfield project to build a new
                    data platform providing a GraphQL API for applications to pull trade data from. This was a fantastic
                    project to work on which massively increased my knowledge of Kubernetes and deploying
                    production-ready applications.
